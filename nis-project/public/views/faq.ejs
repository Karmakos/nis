                                        Before January 1999 when the NIS Act became operational, security intelligence was handled by the Directorate of Security Intelligence (DSI), 
                                        a department of the Office of the President, which operated under a Presidential Charter of 1978 and the Police Act.
                                        In the 1980's, the DSI had taken over the functions of the Kenya Police Special Branch. 
                                        The latter was established under as a branch of the Kenya Police Force during British colonial rule.

                                        The NIS is very sensitive to Human Rights issues and the individual freedoms guaranteed by the Kenya Constitution and other statutes. 
                                        Individuals in Government or private society can only come under NIS investigation if they become part of the threat to national security.
                                        An example here is the case of some government employees and private citizens who facilitated the 
                                        illegal acquisition of Kenyan IDs and residence for some of the terrorists who were involved in the 1998 bomb attack on the US Embassy in Nairobi that killed over 250 people.
